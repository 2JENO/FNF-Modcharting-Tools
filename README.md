# FNF Modcharting Tools
Just a thing I made to make modcharting easier, should be easy to add to most engines.

## Features
- Modifier system for easing in and out effects

- Custom Sustain Renderer (using FlxStrip for stretchy sustains)

- Multiple playfields that can have their own positions and modifiers

- Custom Modifier Support via Hscript (if supported on engine)
